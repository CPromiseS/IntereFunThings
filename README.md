# IntereFunThings' README

## What is the "IntereFunThings"?
IntereFunThings is a repository that contains my daily Python programming practice projects. The goal is to build a collection of **practical, fun, and creative small tools** that solve everyday problems or just bring some joy.

## Why is "IntereFunThings"?
Created on January 17, 2026, during a vacation when I was looking for something fun to code, this repo is a blend of *"interesting"* and *"fun things"*. It’s a space where I can experiment, learn, and build projects that make life a little more enjoyable.

## 🎭 MemeCraft
A Python-based meme generator and collage tool that lets you create custom memes and stitch multiple images together.

### ✨ Features
- **Text Overlay**: Add custom text to any meme image (jpg/png) with control over:
  - Font, size, color, and position (top/bottom/center/left/right).
  - Optional text shadow for better readability.
- **Image Collage**: Combine up to 4 images into a single long strip (horizontal/vertical), with automatic size adjustment to maintain consistent aspect ratio.
- **Non-destructive Editing**: Saves all output to a separate folder (`output_memes`), so your original images are never overwritten.
- **Command-line Interface**: Simple text-based prompts to select functions and input parameters.
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages for missing files, unsupported formats, and invalid inputs.
